## Notes

I had issues with having my input dashboard not disappear underneath my keyboard when I was choosing different
inputs for information.

Issue I could not resolve was not being able to input a decimal on the number keyboard. 

I wanted to make the application not so involved in the onCreate function, but it wound up not being too messy
or that many lines of code.
